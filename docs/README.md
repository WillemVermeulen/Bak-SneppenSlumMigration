A 2D Bak-Sneppen Slum Migration Model
-----------

Slum migration is a phenomenon mostly studied by social sciences and a topic difficult to quantify and make tangible. By modifying a 2D Bak-Sneppen model, often used to model evolution, we attempt to generate the migration patterns. We show that by using only a few rules in a simple cellular automaton complex migration patterns start to occur.
