## A 2D Bak-Sneppen Slum Migration Model

Slum migration is a phenomenon mostly studied by social sciences and a topic difficult to quantify and make tangible. By modifying a 2D [Bak-Sneppen model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bak%E2%80%93Sneppen_model), often used to model evolution, we attempt to generate the migration patterns. We show that by using only a few rules in a simple cellular automaton complex migration patterns start to occur.
