1. Different neighbourhoods (Von Neumann, Moore, etc.)
2. Is Von Neumann neighbourhood in 2D different from 1D with a range of 2?
3. What happens if we heighten the dimensions even Moore ;p

We choose to not reset the ages of surrounding cells of 'migrants', since we're not interested in their changing fitness, but in the migration movements themselves. This means no 'Von Neumann' stars appear.
